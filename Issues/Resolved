Issues fixed after the project demo:

- Customer Clover integration was added
- Full GUI in general was polished (action bar changed, color scheme changed, etc.)
- Edit Activity now autofills with selected event data
- Email notifications now sent when editing and deleting events
- Dates were removed from list view
- List view is now evenly spread out and has headings
- Buttons in list view were changed to easily recoginzable icons (pencil = edit, trash can = delete)
